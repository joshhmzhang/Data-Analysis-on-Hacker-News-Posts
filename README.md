# Data-Analysis-on-Hacker-News-Posts 

In this project, we'll work with a data set of submissions to popular technology site Hacker News. Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.
You can find the data set here:https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts

This data set is Hacker News posts from the last 12 months (up to September 26 2016).

It includes the following columns:

title: title of the post (self explanatory)

url: the url of the item being linked to

num_points: the number of upvotes the post received

num_comments: the number of comments the post received

author: the name of the account that made the post

created_at: the date and time the post was made (the time zone is Eastern Time in the US)
