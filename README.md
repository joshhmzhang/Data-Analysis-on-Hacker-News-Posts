# Data-Analysis-on-Hacker-News-Posts 

In this project, we'll work with a data set of submissions to popular technology site Hacker News. This data set is Hacker News posts during 2015/2016 (one year up to September 26 2016). The two types of posts we'll explore begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Ask HN and Show HN posts are standard posts for Haker News in which users ask the Hacker News community a specific question or share some projects, product or in general some information. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question, such as "What is the best online course you've ever taken?" Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.

The dataset includes the following columns:

title: title of the post (self explanatory)

url: the url of the item being linked to

num_points: the number of upvotes the post received

num_comments: the number of comments the post received

author: the name of the account that made the post

created_at: the date and time the post was made (the time zone is Eastern Time in the US)

The projects inludes two parts:

Part 1

1. Explores the most post on Hacker Newsï¼Ÿ
2. Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
3. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

Part 2 (use pandas)
